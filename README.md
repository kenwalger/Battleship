##Battleship

[Game Description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)#Description)

Project instructions
You’ll build a two player battleship game. Each player will place 
their ships without the other one watching. Then each player will take 
turns guessing locations where their opponent’s ships are. After the 
player has entered a location the screen will be cleared and the 
results of the guess will be displayed on the screen. The next player 
then has a turn. Players continue taking turns until one of the players 
guesses all of the locations on the board that opponent’s ships occupy. 
That player is declared the winner.
